# Applications-of-Image-Processing
## About
  In this project we have developed algorithms to to segment out regions in images and produce masked images, and to enhance the quality 
  of two images when mergerd (flash and non-flash images) and to detect material by analysing spectrogram obtained by sound of the 
  material and implemented hough transformation and k- mean clusturing and algorithms like DCT to detect counterfeit images.
## Technologies required
 * python 3.10
 * anaconda
 * opencv-python==4.8.0.76
 * scikit-image==0.21.0
 * librosa==0.10.1
## Environment Setup
  For Ubantu/Mac install python3.10 and install module venv
  ```
  $ sudo apt install python3 .10 - venv
  ```
  create virtual environment
  ```
  $ python3 -m venv ee604
  ```
  activate environment and install required modules:
  ```
  $ source ee604 / bin / activate
  $ pip install -r requirements . txt
  ```
  for windows, install anaconda and use following command to setup and activate environment and to install required modules:
  ```
  $ conda create -n ee604 python =3.10 anaconda
  $ conda activate ee604
  $ conda install -c conda - forge opencv
  $ conda install -c conda - forge librosa
  $ conda install -c anaconda scikit - image
  ```
